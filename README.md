# Technical Assessment
💼 AI/Data Candidate Technical Assessment: 
- **Objective**: Evaluate Python coding skills, data analysis workflow, machine learning understanding, and ability to reason independently.
- **Estimated Duration**: 3–5 hours
- **Submission Format**: Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts + PDF summary (max 2 pages)
________________________________________
🧠 Part 1: Python Fundamentals & Code Structuring (30 points)
**Task**:
Write a Python class called AnomalyDetector that:
-	Accepts a 1D numerical NumPy array as input.
-	Flags any value that deviates from the mean by more than 2 standard deviations.
-	Returns indices of anomalies.
Requirements:
-	Include proper docstrings and in-code comments.
-	Ensure code handles edge cases (e.g., empty array, non-numeric values).
Bonus: Add a method to visualize the anomalies on a line chart using Matplotlib.
________________________________________
📊 Part 2: Data Analysis & Visualization (30 points)
Dataset: Use a public dataset (e.g., Iris, Titanic, or any UCI repository dataset).
Task:
-	Load and clean the data.
-	Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA): show at least 3 meaningful insights with plots.
-	Create visualizations using Matplotlib or Seaborn (not Tableau or Palantir).
Focus: Interpretability, visual clarity, and quality of insight.
________________________________________
🤖 Part 3: ML Modeling – From Scratch (30 points)
Task:
-	Train a classification model (e.g., logistic regression, decision tree, or a simple neural network) to predict one of the features in your chosen dataset.
-	Split data into training and testing sets.
-	Evaluate using accuracy and confusion matrix.
Bonus: Try hyperparameter tuning or use cross-validation.
________________________________________
✍️ Part 4: Written Explanation & Reflection (10 points)
In a separate PDF file:
-	Briefly explain your approach in each part.
-	Mention any challenges and how you addressed them.
-	Suggest improvements or what you’d do next with more time or resources.

📦 Submission:
Please submit your completed test within 48 hours to this public git hub repo:
-  create a solution branch based on the main
-  commit each part to a seperate folder
-  make sure to add a proper documentation to each segment
-  make a final pull request
-  Ensure all code runs correctly and is self-contained.
